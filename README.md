## Overview

**Lume** is a native IPTV client for the Apple ecosystem. It connects to your own
**Xtream Codes** provider or imports **M3U/M3U8** playlists, indexes the full catalog
locally with **SwiftData** for instant, offline-capable browsing, and plays everything
through a choice of three playback engines — KSPlayer, VLC's universal codec
support, and Apple's native AVPlayer.

It is built entirely in **SwiftUI** with a single, platform-adaptive codebase that
runs on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Vision Pro. Content is enriched with
artwork, cast, trailers, and ratings from **TMDB** and **MDBList** (IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes,
Metacritic, Trakt, Letterboxd), and your viewing activity can be scrobbled to
**Trakt** and **Simkl**.

> **Note** — Lume is a player only. It ships with **no channels, streams, or content**
> of its own. You bring your own Xtream Codes credentials or M3U playlist from a
> provider you are entitled to use. We do not condone piracy — please read the
> [**Anti-Piracy Policy**](ANTI_PIRACY.md).

## Features

#### 📺 Live TV
- Browse channels by category with logos and **EPG** data (now & next)
- Full **program guide** with a scrollable timeline
- **Custom EPG sources**: add external XMLTV feeds, refresh the guide on its own schedule, and sync manually — managed separately from playlist content
- Catchup / time-shift support
- **Multi-View**: watch up to four channels at once in a 2 / 3 / 2×2 grid, with the audio on whichever tile you pick. Each tile can come from a different playlist, which helps if your provider allows only one connection per account (two tiles on the same account still need two connections)
- Channel zapping with recently-watched history
- **In-player channel browser** on tvOS (left-press overlay with category/channel grid)
- Favorite channels and per-channel management

#### 🏅 Sports Hub
- Follow your **leagues and teams** and get a Sports tab and Home rail of their fixtures — yesterday's results, today's games, and what's upcoming
- **150+ competitions** across football (every major European, American, Asian and African league, cups and national teams), the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL, college sports, rugby union and league, AFL, cricket (IPL, T20 World Cup, Big Bash, County Championship and more), ATP and WTA tennis, lacrosse, Formula 1, IndyCar, NASCAR and the UFC
- **Live scores, standings, and full game detail** — timeline, team-stat bars, lineups, and F1 sessions with driver/constructor standings — from **ESPN**
- **EPG-based channel matching** resolves each fixture to a channel already in *your* playlists, so one tap starts playback; when several channels carry a match you get a picker, and your pick is remembered
- Clean, Apple Sports / Strand-style cards tinted with each team's colours
- Followed teams and leagues **sync across your devices** via iCloud, per profile
- A **Lume Pro** feature; available on every platform and hideable from Settings

#### 🎬 Movies & Series
- Category-based browsing with poster grids and horizontal rails
- Rich detail views: plot, rating, cast, director, genre, runtime, release date
- **External ratings** from IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes (critics & audience), Metacritic, Trakt, Letterboxd, and TMDB (via MDBList)
- Season / episode navigation with **per-episode progress**
- TMDB-enriched artwork, logos, and trailers
- Quality / source picker when multiple streams are available

#### 🏠 Home
- Personalized dashboard with a hero carousel
- **Immersive full-screen tvOS home** with TMDB backdrop, crossfading hero, and fold-based scroll snapping
- Continue Watching, Favorites, Recently Watched, and Trending rails
- **For You** rail — on-device recommendations from your watch history and favorites; thumbs-up / thumbs-down a suggestion to tune what you see next, with your votes syncing across devices via iCloud (can be turned off in Settings)

#### 🔎 Discovery & organization
- Global search across Movies, Series, and Live channels with type filtering
- **Background content indexing** — matches the whole library against TMDB and builds on-device embedding vectors (Apple NaturalLanguage) as the foundation for semantic search
- Configurable sort options per category and content type
- Hide and reorder categories to taste
- Favorites and watched markers across every content type
- **Long-press to favorite** — hold a movie or series card anywhere in the app (right-click on macOS, pinch-and-hold on visionOS) to add or remove a favorite without opening its detail screen
- **Deep links** — open a title straight from a URL: `lume://movie/{tmdbId}` and `lume://series/{tmdbId}`

#### ⏱️ Watch tracking
- Automatic resume playback and progress tracking
- Auto-mark-as-watched at 90% completion
- **Next Up** overlay with auto-play for series episodes
- **Skip Intro / Recap** overlay during playback, powered by IntroDB skip windows
- **OpenSubtitles** search from the player's subtitle menu — find and load an external subtitle track for any movie or episode whose stream ships without one
- Optional **Trakt** scrobbling — plus one-tap import of your existing Trakt watched history — and **TMDB** metadata enrichment
- Optional **Simkl** scrobbling via the OAuth 2.0 device flow, with watched-history import on connect and the manual re-import for later
- **Clear watch history** from Settings to reset progress, watched markers, and last-watched dates across all content
- **Now Playing integration** — lock-screen / Control Center metadata, artwork, and remote controls on every engine; playback on Apple TV surfaces on your iPhone's Apple TV remote
- **Background downloads** send a local completion notification; tap it to open Downloads. Notification permission is requested when starting a download, not at launch.

#### 👤 Profiles
- Multiple **user profiles**, each with its own watch history, progress, and favorites
- Switch profiles from the top-left of Home (iOS / macOS), on tvOS with the Siri Remote's **Play/Pause** button, which opens a quick-switch overlay for playlists and profiles, or from Settings on visionOS — Settings stays the place to add, edit and delete them
- Profiles and their state **sync across your devices** via iCloud
- **Parental controls**: mark profiles as child profiles, restrict categories (hidden from browsing and search), and protect them with a PIN required to leave a child profile or open Content Management

#### ⚙️ Library management
- Manage multiple playlists — **Xtream Codes**, **M3U/M3U8**, **Stalker portals**, and **media servers** (add / edit / delete / switch)
- M3U support: URL-based playlists, local file import, URL-tvg EPG auto-detection
- Stalker portal support: MAC-address authentication (with a generated default MAC), with short-lived stream URLs resolved on demand at playback time
- Media-server support: enter one URL and Lume auto-detects the kind —
  - **Jellyfin** and **Emby**: movie and TV-show libraries with artwork, ratings and plot; username + password, session-token auth
  - **Plex**: movie and TV-show sections with artwork, ratings and plot; sign in with your Plex account, paste an `X-Plex-Token`, or connect token-free to a server that allows unauthenticated local access
  - **WebDAV**: recursive folder walk, filenames parsed into movies and series; Basic auth, anonymous shares welcome
  - None of them carries live TV yet, and none downloads yet
- Server info at a glance: status, active connections, expiry
- Background **content sync** with step-by-step progress, which **prunes stale titles** the provider has dropped so the local catalog stays in step
- Scheduled **auto-sync** (every 6 hours, daily, every 3 days, or weekly)

## Supported platforms

Lume is a single SwiftUI codebase that adapts to each platform's idioms — including a
dedicated focus-driven interface and top-shelf branding on tvOS.

| Platform | Minimum OS | Devices |
|---|---|---|
| iOS / iPadOS | 18.0 | iPhone, iPad |
| macOS | 15.0 | Apple Silicon & Intel |
| tvOS | 18.0 | Apple TV 4K |
| visionOS | 2.0 | Apple Vision Pro |

> Liquid Glass and the iOS 26 navigation refinements are used where available and fall back to standard system materials on older OS versions.

---

## Playback engines

Lume ships with three interchangeable engines, ordered into a **priority list** in
**Settings**. Playback starts with your preferred engine and **automatically falls
back** to the next one whenever an engine can't play a stream, so a codec or stream
one engine chokes on is retried with another before any error is shown. The default
order is **KSPlayer → VLCKit → AVPlayer** (degrading to whichever engines are
available on the platform).

| Engine | Backend | Best for | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **VLCKit** | VLCKit 4 (libVLC) | Maximum compatibility | Virtually any format/codec, hardware-accelerated 4K HDR, Picture in Picture, broadest IPTV support |
| **KSPlayer** | FFmpeg (FFmpegKit) | Wide IPTV support | Handles most formats common in IPTV streams; configurable decoder (FFmpeg / VideoToolbox) |
| **AVPlayer** | AVFoundation | HLS & MP4 | Native Apple player with **custom unified overlay** matching the other engines |

Prefer a third-party app? Lume can hand streams off to an **external player** —
**Infuse**, **VLC** or **VidHub** — via their deep-link APIs, selectable in **Settings**.
Because not every app handles every stream — Infuse plays movies and series but no
live channels — the hand-off covers **movies & series** by default, and can be
switched to **live TV** or to both. Downloads always play in Lume, and playback falls
back to the built-in player when the selected app is not installed.

Send playback to the TV with **AirPlay** — a route picker sits in the player overlay.
Full-screen video is delivered through Apple's AVPlayer: on iOS and iPadOS, picking a
receiver while on the KSPlayer or VLCKit engine hands the current stream to AVPlayer
for the cast and resumes where it left off (formats AVPlayer can't decode fall back to
audio-only). On macOS the picker appears on the AVPlayer engine, which routes the
picked receiver directly. (Chromecast support is on the [roadmap](#roadmap).)

## Getting started

The easiest way to use Lume is to [**download it from the App Store**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lume-iptv-player/id6779551584) — available on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Vision Pro. To build from source, follow the steps below.

### Requirements

- **Xcode 26.4** or later
- An **Xtream Codes** account (server URL, username, password), an **M3U/M3U8 playlist URL**, a **Stalker portal** (portal URL + MAC address), or a **media server** (a Jellyfin, Emby or Plex base URL, or a WebDAV folder URL — credentials depend on the server)
- *(Optional)* a [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) API access token for metadata enrichment
- *(Optional)* a [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications) application for scrobbling
- *(Optional)* a [Simkl](https://simkl.com/settings/developer/new/) application for scrobbling (OAuth V2 — "TV, devices & command line" registration needs only the client id)
- *(Optional)* an [MDBList](https://mdblist.com/preferences/) API key for IMDb / Rotten Tomatoes / Metacritic / Trakt / Letterboxd ratings
- *(Optional)* an [IntroDB](https://introdb.app) API key for intro / recap skip windows
- *(Optional)* an [OpenSubtitles](https://www.opensubtitles.com/consumers) consumer API key for in-player subtitle search

### Build & run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bilipp/Lume.git
cd Lume
open Lume.xcodeproj
```

Select the **Lume** scheme and a target destination (iPhone, Mac, Apple TV, or Vision
Pro), then build and run (`⌘R`). On first launch, sign in with your Xtream credentials
or import an M3U playlist, and Lume will sync your catalog.

> Remote dependencies (KSPlayer, FFmpegKit, VLCKit) are resolved automatically by Swift
> Package Manager on first build.

**Code signing.** The project ships with the maintainer's Development Team
(`DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`) and bundle identifier (`com.bilipp.lume`). Simulator builds run as
is. To run on a physical device, open **Signing & Capabilities** for each target and set
your own team (and, if needed, a unique bundle identifier) — or clear the team for a
simulator-only build. Don't commit these personal signing changes back to the repo.

---

## Configuration

Optional integrations (TMDB, MDBList, IntroDB, OpenSubtitles, and Trakt) are configured through a
repo-root `.env` file. The `Scripts/inject-env.sh` build phase reads it and injects the
values into the built app's `Info.plist` — keeping secrets out of source control. `.env`
is gitignored, and if it is missing the dependent features simply degrade gracefully
(e.g. the Trending rail hides).

Copy the template and fill in the keys you have:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```dotenv
# TMDB — metadata, artwork & trailers
TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_tmdb_v4_read_access_token

# MDBList — IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, Trakt & Letterboxd ratings
MDBLIST_API_KEY=your_mdblist_api_key

# IntroDB — intro / recap skip windows (read access works unauthenticated)
INTRO_DB_API_KEY=your_introdb_api_key

# OpenSubtitles — in-player subtitle search
OPENSUBTITLES_API_KEY=your_opensubtitles_api_key

# Trakt — watch scrobbling (device OAuth flow)
TRAKT_CLIENT_ID=your_trakt_client_id
TRAKT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_trakt_client_secret

# Simkl — watch scrobbling (OAuth 2.0 device flow, AUTH V2)
SIMKL_CLIENT_ID=your_simkl_client_id
SIMKL_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

Every key is optional — Lume builds and runs fine with an empty `.env` or none at all.

Trakt uses the **device OAuth flow** (no embedded web view), which works on tvOS as
well as iOS/macOS. Tokens are stored securely in the Keychain.

Simkl uses the **OAuth 2.0 device flow** (AUTH V2, RFC 8628) — likewise no web view,
so it works on every platform including tvOS, and access tokens are refreshed
automatically. A "TV, devices & command line" registration has no secret; the secret
line is only for a "Server apps & services" registration. Tokens are stored in the
Keychain as well.

OpenSubtitles needs both halves: the API key above identifies the build, while
*downloading* a subtitle needs a free [opensubtitles.com](https://www.opensubtitles.com)
account signed in under Settings → Integrations → OpenSubtitles (the daily download
allowance is per account). Searching works signed out. That session token is stored in
the Keychain too.

---

## Testing

Lume has an extensive test suite split across unit/integration tests (**Swift Testing**)
and UI automation (**XCTest**).

| Target | Framework | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `LumeTests` | Swift Testing | DTO decoding, URL building, API client & retry, models, sort options, sync progress & content sync, playable media, player settings, Trakt & Simkl token stores + watched importers + Simkl client, content organizing, **M3U parser/classifier/sync**, **MDBList client**, **OpenSubtitles client & subtitle-search query**, **Next Episode resolver**, **Gzip file streaming** |
| `LumeUITests` | XCTest | App launch & performance, login flow, tab navigation, playlist detail, settings, **M3U playlist import flow** |

Run the full suite:

```bash
xcodebuild test \
  -project Lume.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Lume \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro'
```

Run a single target:

```bash
# Unit / integration tests only
xcodebuild test -project Lume.xcodeproj -scheme Lume \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' \
  -only-testing:LumeTests

# UI tests only
xcodebuild test -project Lume.xcodeproj -scheme Lume \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' \
  -only-testing:LumeUITests
```

Decoding tests run against real, anonymized API payloads in `ExampleData/`. Shared
helpers in `LumeTests/Helpers/TestHelpers.swift` provide an in-memory `ModelContainer`
and JSON loaders so tests need no bundle-resource setup.

### [discord.gg/DMnQfr69Ug](https://discord.gg/DMnQfr69Ug)

</div>

The Discord is the fastest way to get help and the best place to follow where Lume is
going:

- 🛟 **Support** — playlist, EPG, and playback troubleshooting with people running the
  same providers and devices
- 🐞 **Bug reports** — quick triage before (or alongside) a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/bilipp/Lume/issues)
- 🗺️ **Feature requests** — help shape what gets built next
- 🚀 **Releases** — every new version announced as it ships, plus beta feedback
- 💬 **Just hanging out** — talk to the maintainer and other users directly

One rule: **no piracy talk** — no requests for, or sharing of, streams, playlists, or
credentials. See the [**Anti-Piracy Policy**](ANTI_PIRACY.md).

---

## Contributing

> 💬 Question or feedback? The **[Discord](https://discord.gg/DMnQfr69Ug)** is usually
> faster than an issue — see [Community](#community).

Contributions are welcome! The short version:

1. Open an [issue](https://github.com/bilipp/Lume/issues) to discuss a bug or feature.
2. Fork the repo and create a feature branch off `main`.
3. Run `./Scripts/setup.sh` once to install the git hooks and lint/format tooling —
   [Lefthook](https://lefthook.dev), SwiftFormat, and SwiftLint are all vendored as
   Swift Package plugins, so you only need Xcode's Swift toolchain (no Homebrew or Mint).
4. Make sure the test suite passes before opening a pull request.

See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for the full guide — dev setup, coding style,
localization, commit conventions, and the PR checklist.

## Anti-piracy

Lume is a **player only** — it ships with no channels, streams, playlists, or media of
any kind, and it pre-configures no providers. Every stream you watch comes solely from
the Xtream Codes credentials or M3U playlist **you** supply.

We do **not** condone or support piracy. Use Lume only with content you are legally
entitled to access — a legitimate IPTV subscription, your own playlists, or
free-to-air and openly licensed streams. Requesting, sharing, or linking to pirated
streams, playlists, or credentials is **not allowed** in this repository, issues, pull
requests, or any community space, and may result in removal and bans.

Please read the full **[Anti-Piracy Policy](ANTI_PIRACY.md)** before opening issues or
joining the community.
