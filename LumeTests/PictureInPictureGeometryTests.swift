//  macOS sample-buffer PiP (KSPlayer) needs Lume to redo AVKit's
//  panel geometry: AVKit leaves the picture unscaled and offset by the player
//  window's letterbox. These pin the transform `MacPictureInPictureScaler`
//  computes, on layer trees shaped like the ones AVKit actually builds in the
//  panel — measured from a running app, including the two layouts that cropped
//  the picture before the math took the picture layer's own rect into account.
