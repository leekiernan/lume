//
//  The single path an in-player transport control takes to change stream. All
//  three engine hosts (KSPlayer, VLCKit, AVPlayer) drove their own
//  near-identical copy of the tvOS channel swap; the on-screen previous/next
//  controls would have added two more. This is that logic, once.
//
//  It only ever *asks* for the swap: the target is handed back to the host
//  through `onSelectMedia`, which rebuilds the engine off a changed `media`.
//  Reaching into a running engine instead re-prepares a live session, which
//  frees the demuxer context under the decode threads.

/// view, so every surface that can change stream — the transport buttons, a
/// macOS arrow key, the Siri Remote, the lock screen — shares one cooldown.
/// A swapper per surface would let two of them start a decoder teardown apiece
/// inside the same window, which is the shape this guards against.

/// Never read from a view body: nothing here invalidates a view, so the
