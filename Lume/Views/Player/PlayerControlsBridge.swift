//
//  PlayerControlsBridge.swift
//  Lume
//
//  What the engine's controls and the episode buttons (`PlayerEpisodeOverlays`)
//  need from each other. The host puts one in the environment for the player
//  it builds; each engine draws its own controls and owns the remote, so both
//  sides meet here rather than through engine-specific paths.
//
//  - Layout: each engine's controls report their bottom block
//    (`reportsControlsHeight()`), and the buttons rise above it.
//  - tvOS focus: with the controls hidden, an episode button holds the remote
//    rather than the engine's invisible tap-catcher, and a direction pressed
//    on it raises the controls just as the catcher would
//    (`episodeButtonFocusHandoff`).
//  - tvOS remote claims: overlays the host layers above the engine (a sports
//    alert, the way back from a detour) take a Play/Pause press, or the Back
//    press that would close the player, before the engine acts on it.
