//
//  ExternalSubtitleLoading.swift
//  Lume
//
//  The engine-agnostic surface for side-loading a subtitle file that isn't
//  embedded in the stream — what the OpenSubtitles search sheet hands back.
//
//  Each engine gets there differently (KSPlayer takes a `SubtitleInfo`, VLCKit
//  a "playback slave"), so the conformances
//  live here side by side rather than scattered through four coordinators.
//  AVPlayer is the one engine that genuinely can't: `AVURLAsset` has no
//  sidecar-subtitle API, so it declares itself unsupported and the search entry
//  hides while it is driving playback (which, outside AirPlay, is the user's own
//  engine choice).
