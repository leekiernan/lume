//
//  PlayerItemNavButtons.swift
//  Lume
//
//  The previous / next transport control that flanks play-pause in every
//  non-tvOS engine overlay: the surrounding episodes of a series, or the
//  channels either side of a live one. Authored once because all three engines
//  mount it — adopting it in three of them would make the control vanish the
//  moment playback fell back to the fourth.
//
//  tvOS drives the same swap from the Siri Remote instead and gains no
//  on-screen channel buttons, so this whole file is gated out there.
//

    /// Call sites gate on `neighbours.axis != nil` rather than leaning on the
    /// `.none` branch below: an `EmptyView` returned from *inside* a concrete
    /// view is still a laid-out child, so a movie's transport row would keep
    /// the `HStack`'s spacing at both ends and sit wider than it does without
    /// this control at all.
