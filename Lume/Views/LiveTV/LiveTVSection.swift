//
//  LiveTVSection.swift
//  Lume
//
//  The Live TV browse surfaces (the category rail / sidebar / bar and the
//  channel list / EPG guide) are driven by "sections" rather than raw
//  categories: alongside each synced live `Category` there are two virtual
//  collections — Favorites and Recently Watched — that cut across categories.
//
//  A `LiveTVSection` is what the user selects in the rail; a `LiveChannelScope`
//  is what the channel list / guide query against. `LiveChannelQuery` builds the
//  right `@Query` descriptor, the in-memory playlist scoping those lists need
//  (their predicate can't be parameterised on the playlist-prefixed id), and the
//  bounded probes that decide whether the virtual collections are offered at
//  all. `LiveTVSections` assembles the rail from both, `LiveTVCategoryMemo`
//  keeps its category half from being rebuilt on every body pass.
//
