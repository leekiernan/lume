//  The now/next EPG shown on a channel card, resolved once for a whole list off
//  the main thread. Channel cards used to each register their own `@Query` for
//  EPG listings — a category with hundreds of channels meant hundreds of live
//  SwiftData observers, each running an (unindexed) full scan of the guide table
//  and all re-firing together when an EPG sync wrote new rows. The list owns a
//  single bounded fetch instead and passes each card its precomputed pair.
