//  SettingsView+Player.swift

//
//  The iOS / macOS / visionOS Player settings groups: the engine priority and
//  per-engine options links, the preferred audio language row, and the external
//  player hand-off. Split out of SettingsView to keep that file within the
//  project's line-count cap; tvOS builds its own pane in SettingsView+TVPlayer.
