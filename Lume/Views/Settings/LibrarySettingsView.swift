//
//  LibrarySettingsView.swift
//  Lume
//
//  One screen for everything that shapes what the app shows, organised by the
//  same areas as the top navigation: Home, Movies, Series, Live TV, and Sports.
//  the separate "Content Management" and "Layout" entries, which split the same
//  decisions across two places — one by content type, the other by page.
//
//  Each area can be switched off entirely, which removes its tab *and* stops it
//  syncing (see `AppAreaSettings`). Drilling into an area gives whatever it has
//  to configure: rows for Home, rows and categories for Movies and Series,
//  categories and channels for Live TV. Sports is a sibling settings item but
//  remains operationally dependent on Live TV because fixtures open its EPG
//  channels.
