//
//  TVHomeFold.swift — shared hero fold geometry
//  Lume
//
//  Geometry and scroll-snapping for the immersive tvOS home in
//  `TVHomeScreen.swift`: the shared layout metrics, the three fold zones the
//  scroll can rest in, and the `ScrollTargetBehavior` that snaps focus-driven
//  scrolls between them.
//
//  tvOS fully owns focus and scrolling — the snap behavior only retargets
//  where a focus-driven scroll comes to REST; it never re-layouts content in
//  response to focus, which the focus engine cannot tolerate (see the earlier
//  collapse-on-focus attempt that had to be reverted).
