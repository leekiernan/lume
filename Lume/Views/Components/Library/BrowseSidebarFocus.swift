//  Lume
//
//  tvOS focus behaviour of `BrowseSidebarPanel`, the browse panel Movies,
//  Series, Live TV and Sports share. A panel that slides in over the
//  page has to *take* focus, or the page underneath stays live: the user keeps
//  navigating a list they can no longer read, and neither Menu nor a press to
//  the right reaches the panel, so there is no way back out of it.
//
//  Landing follows `landTVFocus`, the same release-settle-assert every tvOS
//  surface over live content uses — scrolling to the target first, because the
//  row to land on is routinely below the fold in a long category list.
//
//  Where to land is the caller's `target`, and the panel remembers the row it
//  was last left on so reopening returns there rather than to the top. That
//  matters wherever a panel is opened repeatedly against a live selection.
//
//  tvOS only — every other platform has a pointer and a close button.
