//  When to put the player up after Watch on a Sports surface. Watch is often
//  pressed inside a sheet or cover — a game's detail, the channel picker —
//  and a sheet's dismissal isn't done when its binding drops to `nil`. A
//  full-screen player presented while it is still animating out is torn down
//  and re-presented once it has gone: two players, two stream opens, and the
//  second trips the provider's connection cap (for example, HTTP 429). So media chosen from a sheet waits here until the sheet's
//  `onDismiss`. Standard hub/Home sheets share it; the tvOS hub also uses its
//  direct-play path. Pushed tvOS Match Centre keeps its own player above the
//  detail screen, with no sheet dismissal needed.
