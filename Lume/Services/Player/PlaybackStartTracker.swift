//  PlaybackStartTracker.swift
//  Lume
//
//  The one rule every playback engine uses to decide that a stream has
//  started — its first frame is on screen. That decision disarms the startup
//  watchdog, drops the spinner and stamps QoE join time, so getting it wrong in
//  one engine means a playing stream is declared dead and the host falls back
//  to the next engine.
//
//  Each engine used to decide this its own way, off its own "playing" signal
//  alone, and each signal has a hole: VLC does not re-emit `.playing` when a
//  new media is loaded into a player that is already playing (a catch-up seek),
//  and KSPlayer's async state callbacks can be consumed by the stream a swap
//  just replaced. The playhead has no such hole. It only advances while frames
//  are being presented, so real progress on *this* stream proves it started
//  whatever the engine's state machine said.
//
//  This is the first piece of a shared playback supervisor. The startup
//  watchdog, stall detection and the reconnect budget still live in each
//  engine and are meant to move in here later; for now it only answers "has
//  this stream started?".

import Foundation

/// Decides, once per stream, that playback has started.
///
/// Started means one of:
/// - **The engine's own signal** (`noteEngineStarted`) — KSPlayer's
///   `.bufferFinished`, VLC's `.playing`, AVPlayer's `.playing`. An engine whose
///   callbacks can be stale (KSPlayer) passes
///   `requiringReady` and reports its "ready" state through `noteEngineReady`,
///   so a leftover callback from the previous stream is ignored.
/// - **The playhead advancing** (`notePlayhead`) by `proofAdvance` past the
///   lowest sample seen on this stream. A lower later sample re-bases, because
///   the stream a swap replaced can still report first; a forward jump of more
///   than `maxSampleStep` between two samples re-bases too, because that is a
///   seek (a resume, a stale sample from another position), not playback.
/// - **Displayed frames advancing** (`noteDisplayedFrames`) on the current
///   media. VLC's live clock can freeze while frames continue to display.
///
/// Each note returns the `Proof` exactly once per stream — on the call that
/// flips it to started — so the caller runs its first-frame side effects
/// (disarm the watchdog, clear the spinner, `PlaybackQoE.noteFirstFrame`)
/// once. `beginStream()` starts the next stream from scratch.
///
/// A value type with no clock and no engine state, so it is fed from whatever
/// time callback each engine has and tested without one.
