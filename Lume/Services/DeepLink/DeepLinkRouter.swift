/// environment; `MoviesView` and `SeriesView` bind their `NavigationStack` to the
/// matching path so an `onOpenURL` push lands in the right tab.
///
/// It also holds the tab state that has to outlive the tab's view: tabs are
/// unmounted when not shown (tvOS) or after sitting unshown for a while
/// (`IdleUnmountingTab`, iOS/macOS), and what the viewer navigated to should
/// still be there when they come back.
