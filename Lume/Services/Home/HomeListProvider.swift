//
//  Resolves a public "list" URL the user pastes into a custom Home row
//  (`CustomHomeSection`) into TMDB-keyed entries, which Home then matches
//  against the local catalog exactly the way the trending rows do.
//
//  One provider per site. The user pastes the human-readable list page URL and
//  the provider works out the machine-readable form — they should never have to
//  know that MDBList serves JSON from a `/json` suffix. Adding a site means
//  adding a provider and listing it in `HomeListCatalog.providers`.
