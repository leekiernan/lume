//  What the Continue Watching rail shows for each title: which episode a
//  series continues with, how far into it the viewer is, whether there's
//  anything left to continue, and how much of a movie remains.
//
//  A movie is finished once it's marked watched (`WatchCompletion`). A series
//  has no such flag — it's finished when its last episode is watched and
//  nothing is in progress; a new season makes it unfinished again. Pure: the
//  loader below turns a series' episodes into plain values first.
