//
//  ContentIndexer.swift
//  Lume
//
//  Builds the local content index: resolves each movie and series against
//  TMDB (searching by cleaned title when the provider supplies no id), applies
//  the same enrichment the detail screens use, and stores an on-device
//  embedding vector that "For You" ranks against.
//
//  Which embedding model that is depends on the platform (`TextEmbedder`), and
//  the two produce incomparable vectors — so the pass stamps the vector space it
//  used and drops everything it can no longer compare when that changes.
//
//  Designed to run slowly in the background: items are processed in small
//  chunks on a dedicated ModelContext with pauses in between, so neither TMDB
//  nor the main thread is hammered. The loop waits while a playlist sync is
//  running, while an iCloud import is in flight, while the player is up and
//  while the user is browsing — even a background-context save forces the main
//  context to merge and re-run every @Query, which hitches KSPlayer and stalls
//  browsing on a large catalog.
