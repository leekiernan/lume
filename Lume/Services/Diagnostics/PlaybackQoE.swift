//  PlaybackQoE.swift
//  Lume
//
//  Quality-of-experience accounting for playback — the metric set video
//  services actually measure, rather than CPU time:
//
//  * **Join time** (time-to-first-frame): playback requested → first frame
//    rendered, per engine. This is the number behind "streams take ages to
//    start".
//  * **Rebuffer ratio**: seconds stalled mid-stream over seconds watched.
//  * **Exit before video start**: sessions the user abandoned while still
//    spinning — the harshest signal that startup is too slow.
//  * **Startup failures / engine fallbacks**: how often the preferred engine
//    can't open a stream and hands off.
//
//  All three engines report into this one object at choke points they already
//  have (`hasStartedPlayback` flipping true, the startup watchdog arming), so
//  the numbers are directly comparable across KSPlayer, VLCKit and AVPlayer. It also emits the `PlayerStartup` signpost interval, which is
//  what `LumePerformanceTests` and Instruments read.
//
//  Counters are aggregated in memory and flushed to `UserDefaults` at session
//  boundaries only — never periodically. A recurring write during playback is
//  exactly what used to hitch KSPlayer every few seconds.
